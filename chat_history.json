The admin access should be implemented as a hidden feature.\n*   **Core Functionality Screens:**\n    *   **Customer:** Browse businesses, view property details, contact businesses.\n    *   **Business:** Create/manage profile, invite workers, manage tasks.\n    *   **Worker:** View jobs, communicate with managers.\n*   **Navigation:** Implement a tab-based navigation for easy access to different sections of the app.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light gray for a clean feel)\n    *   Text: `#333333` (Dark gray for readability)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#777777` (Medium gray for less important text)\n    *   Primary: `#007BFF` (Blue for main actions and branding)\n    *   Secondary: `#6C757D` (Gray for secondary actions)\n    *   Accent: `#28A745` (Green for success states)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White for card backgrounds)\n    *   Highlight: `#FFC107` (Yellow for important highlights)\n*   **Typography:** Use a modern, clean font like \"System\" (default) for a professional look.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Implement User Authentication:** Create the authentication flows for the three user roles, including the hidden admin access.\n2.  **Set up Tab Navigation:** Modify the `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` file to include tabs for the main sections of the app (e.g., Home, Browse, Profile).\n3.  **Create Core Screens:** Build the core screens for each user role, as described above.\n4.  **Implement Basic UI Elements:** Add basic UI elements like buttons, text inputs, and lists to the screens.\n5.  **Implement the color scheme:** Modify the theme to use the colors specified above.\n\nAfter the plan is implemented, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n\nNow, I will ask the coding agent to implement this plan.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-04T15:52:58.052205"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement the CleanConnect app with the specified user roles, authentication, and features.
